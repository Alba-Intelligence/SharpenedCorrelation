#
# ## The Sharpened Cosine Similarity
#
# The Sharpened Cosine Similarity is a modified form of cosine distance that showed over the past few months, thought up by Brandon Rohrer .
#
#
#
# [https://www.rpisoni.dev/posts/cossim-convolution/]()
# [https://www.rpisoni.dev/posts/cossim-convolution-part2/]()

# The usual cosine transform
#
# $$scs(s, k) = \frac{s \cdot k}{\Vert{s}\Vert \Vert{k} \Vert}$$
#
# is modified It looks like
#
# $$scs(s, k) = sign(s \cdot k)\Biggl(\frac{s \cdot k}{(\Vert{s}\Vert + q)(\Vert{k}\Vert + q)}\Biggr)^p$$

# ## How does it work?
#
# 2 Parameters are introduced:
#
# - $q$ to floor the value of the norm of either vector;
# - $p$ an exponentiation factor to decide
#
# Let's imagine the case of a picture. Some zones might contain a lot of information (e.g. an airplane); some just noise (e.g. various shades of blue in the background).

# ### Ignore the irrelevant
#
# When running a convolution over the picture, and under the assumption that the entire picture has been normalised, the norm of a patch around the plane will be higher that over the sky. But, when it comes to apply the cosine transform, those local vectors will be renormalised to 1. The effect is that the the convolution filters will be trained to find information assuming that each of those 2 zones are of equal relevance.
#
# The $q$ parameter helps. Over a patch of sky, $q$ will be much higher than $\Vert{s}\Vert$. Therefore the value of the convolution will be seriously decreased.
#
# No training budget will be wasted on training on the useless. $q$ clips the noise out.

# ### Focus on anything even remotely interesting, or only zoom in the critical
#
# The $p$ exponentiation parameters could be anything from $0^+$ to $+\infty$.
#
# If $p = 1$, we have the normal cosine distance.
#
# If $p > 1$, we have a convex function. At the extreme, we have a curve that is almost $0$ almost everywhere until the cosine distance becomes close to $1$. __If $p > 1$, we only look at the truely interesting patches__. __$p > 1$ is super sensitivity__
#
# Conversely, if $p < 1$, we get a concave curve. For very low (positive) values of $p$, the curve will be close to $1$ everywhere until the cosine distance gets close to $0$. __If $p \rightarrow 0$, the truely useless is ignored, anything else is worth considering__. __$p \rightarrow 0$ is super specificity__.
#
# (P.S. despite decades of exposure to those words, I still reach out to a dictionary to know specificity vs.sensitivity. Intuition A+. Vocabulary. Z-)
#

# ## How to improve?
#
# A few improvements, some implemented in the code, some not.

# ### Keep $p$ reasonable (implemented)
#
# Instead of using a parameter $p$, use a _Soft ReLU_ shape:
#
# $$scs(s, k) = sign(s \cdot k)\Biggl(\frac{s \cdot k}{(\Vert{s}\Vert + q)(\Vert{k}\Vert + q)}\Biggr)^ {\log \left( 1 + \exp \left( p \right) \right) }$$
#
# $p$ can now range from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ with the highest gradients around 0, i.e. around an exponent of 1.
#

# ### Get rid of the cosine transform and go for a real Pearson cross-correlation  (implemented)
#
# Cosine distance is great for embeddings. But for determining similarities, not so much. Let's go for a true cross-correlation.
#
# $$S = \sum{s - \bar{s}}$$
# $$K = \sum{k - \bar{k}}$$
#
# $$scs(s, k) = sign(S \times K))\Biggl(\frac{S \times K}{\left( \sqrt{(\sum{s - \bar{s})^2}} + q \right) \cdot \left( \sqrt{(\sum{k - \bar{k})^2}} + q \right)}\Biggr)^ {\log \left( 1 + \exp \left( p \right) \right) }
# $$
#
#
# A bit more of a mouthful and would translate into a dog's breakfast in TensorFlow...
#

# ### Robustify (not implemented)
#
# $q$ brings noise removal. But the cross-correlation is still sensitive to outliers. Clipping for example at Ïƒ = 2 (Winsorised correlation) after re-normalisation, Spearman or one of myriad other variants with different performance profiles.

# ### Use actual information content as the norm  (not implemented)
#
# When the Salvator Mundi was put on the market a couple of years ago (and eventually bought for half a billion US), numerous methods were used to confirm its authenticity. An interesting approach came from an AI company that had aplly a similar method to Rembrandt's. See [https://www.art-critique.com/en/2019/04/a-eye-another-tool-for-the-authenticating-artworks/](), on Arxiv [https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10600]() for a (hardly) little more technical content on Salvator Mundi work, this [https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12436]() for a bit more, and the code at [https://github.com/stevenjayfrank/A-Eye]().
#
# Key to their method method is to focus the training and inference on sections of the painting where the information content is high.
#
# This could be use to replace the $q$ parameter.
#

# # Show me the __Julia__ code
#
# Many have contributed TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations. See [https://e2eml.school/scs.html]().
#
# Time for some Julia supremacy with the [https://fluxml.ai/](Flux.jl) library. Code is in the repo. Running under Julia 1.7, packages upgraded to the latest versions.
